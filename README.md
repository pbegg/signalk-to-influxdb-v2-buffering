# signalk-to-influxdb-v2-buffering
 Plugin that saves data to an influxdbv2 database - buffers data without internet connection

The plugin is designed to do batch writes to a cloud hosted influxdb2.0 data base. If the conenction to the influxdb is down the batch of metrics is saved to disc in JSON format. Once the next successful write is completed it will load all the buffered files and send them as one large batch to influxdb.

## Influx Measurement format
It is storing the metrics in the following format eg: 
propulsion.port.transmission.oilPressure = 30.0

```
{
	"measurement": 'propulsion'
	"tags": {
		"engine": "port",
		"component": "transmission",
		"vesselname": "self.name"
	},
	"fields" : {
		oilPressure: 30.0
	},
	timestamp: 1611618842558

```


## Paths Supported
Currently the pulgin is only supporting 'navigation' and 'propulsion' paths.
